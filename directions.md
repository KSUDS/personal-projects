# Personal Data Projects

This repository will give each of us practice with [Forking](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) and [Pull Requests](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests).  Our use case is simple but it goes through the steps that any large project of developers would need to complete to collaborate.

1. After you have finished one of your personal data projects and you have the project shared on Github, you will fork this repo.
2. Alter the table in the README.md to highlight your project.
3. Complete a pull request.
4. Make sure that `KSUDS/personal-projects` has accepted your pull request.
